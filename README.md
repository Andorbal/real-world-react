# Real-world React from the ground up

Learning React can get awfully complicated. Flux, Redux, server side rendering, React Native, higher order components, functions as child components, CSS in JS, and more. Let's simplify the equation: build a real world application using React and Redux, learning patterns and practices to make reusable, composable components as we go. Whether you are brand new to React or have some experience with it, you should walk away with a solid understanding of how to compose React applications.
