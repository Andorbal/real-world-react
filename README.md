# IMPORTANT NOTE FOR CODEMASHERS

The last example in the code, the "real world" app, is not yet complete, and I owe you deep apologies. It's coming as soon as soon as I can resolve a couple issues with it.
All my fault. Feel free to berate me at the start of the precompiler! Follow this repo or check the #precompiler room on Slack for a notification when it goes up.


# Real-world React from the ground up

Learning React can get awfully complicated. Flux, Redux, server side rendering, React Native, higher order components, functions as child components, CSS in JS, and more. Let's simplify the equation: build a real world application using React and Redux, learning patterns and practices to make reusable, composable components as we go. Whether you are brand new to React or have some experience with it, you should walk away with a solid understanding of how to compose React applications.

## Tools

1. Node, npm/yarn ([Node](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/))
2. `create-react-app` ([GitHub](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app))
3. Editor/IDE ([Atom](https://atom.io/), [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/), [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/), etc.)
4. Chrome or Firefox
5. [React DevTools browser extension](https://github.com/facebook/react-devtools)
6. [Redux DevTools browser extension](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension)

## Libraries

Offline copies of some libraries used to make it easy for the session (no CDN requests, npm/bower installs, etc.)

1. Font Awesome 5 (`/libraries/fontawesome5`)

## First steps

1. All examples are based off `create-react-app`, so refer to its documentation for any changes you want to make.
2. For any example you want to run, open that directory and run `npm install` or `yarn`, then `npm start` or `yarn start`
3. If your browser doesn't automatically open, launch `http://localhost:3000` to view the site
4. I apologize for the mix of semicolons and not ... no semicolons is a thing I do now
